# Phase 14 §1 — Sidekiq job wrapping `Game::Igdb::SyncGame#call`.
#
# Single argument `game_id`. On `Game::Igdb::Client::RateLimited` /
# `ServerError` / network errors, raises so Sidekiq retries with
# exponential backoff (5 attempts). On `ValidationError` (game ID
# does not exist on IGDB) the local row is stamped with
# `last_sync_error` inside `Game::Igdb::SyncGame` and the job swallows
# the raise so Sidekiq does NOT retry.
#
# Phase 14 §1 polish (2026-05-10) — `games.resyncing` mutex flag.
# The job flips `resyncing` true at start (skips when already in
# flight, so duplicate enqueues are no-ops) and back to false in
# an `ensure` block so a crash inside `SyncGame` still releases
# the lock.
#
# Phase 27 v2 spec 03 — two-layer lock, mirroring `ReindexAllJob`'s pattern:
#
#   Layer 1 — DB mutex (`games.resyncing` Boolean). Set at start,
#             cleared in `ensure`. The controller consults the same
#             flag to short-circuit duplicate enqueues from the
#             breadcrumb [sync] click.
#   Layer 2 — Sidekiq uniqueness lock (`sidekiq_options lock:
#             :until_executed, on_conflict: :log`). Pito runs on
#             Sidekiq OSS without `sidekiq-unique-jobs`, so the
#             option is a NO-OP intent declaration today — the DB
#             flag (Layer 1) is the real safety net. If the gem is
#             ever added, the keys are already in place.
#
# UI feedback while a resync is in flight is handled entirely on
# `/games/:id` by the page-level `auto-refresh` controller (reloads
# every ~5 s while `@game.resyncing?` is true). The dedicated sync
# pane / banner and the `_sync_status` partial were removed —
# breadcrumb [sync] (muted-while-syncing per Wave C8) is the only
# control surface.
#
# R1 (2026-05-25) — bundle cover-art fan-out removed with bundles.

    # refresh polling immediately (no race against Sidekiq pickup).

    # lockstep — the controller now owns the gate (it short-circuits
    # duplicate user clicks with the "already resyncing." flash), and
    # console / rake callers that bypass the controller still get a
    # full sync because the job unconditionally flips the flag and runs.
